This was another fun little project to try to optimize Pokemon teams for online battles
Essentially it would scrape data from online repositories (pokemonhackaton code) and then use this data to inform a) which Pokemon were most popular in the current meta and b) which Pokemon were the best matchups against other Pokemon (in Optimization code)
Based on this pulled data, the code would form an optimal team of 3 that was most likely to would win you the most games based on the current meta
Would also try to predict correct ordering of Pokemon based on ordering in meta
